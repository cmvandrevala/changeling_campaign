#
# Around the perimeter of the grounds, there are numerous campers, trailers, beasts of burden, vehicles, etc. that bring goods in and out of the market on a daily basis.
#
# There are actually no roads within the fair itself.  Merchants simply set up their tent in any open spot that they can find.  This means that tents change their location on an almost daily basis.
#
# There are mobile vendors who move around the fairgrounds with carts full of wares.
#
# There are street performers, artists, singers, etc.
#
# There are absolutely no thieves.
#
# There are "illegal" items bought and sold all the time by almost all vendors
