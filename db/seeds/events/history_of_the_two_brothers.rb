At that moment, The Problem Solver visits him and offers him a simple solution. She tells him about Goblin Market not too far from where he stands and mentions that she can get both him and Gon stalls where they can start a new life. She can bestow upon him a talent for precognition, making him indespensible within the market. He wholeheartedly agrees, but inquires as to why she is not asking for Gon's consent as well as his. The Problem Solver says that Gon is blindly loyal to his older brother - he will (grudgingly) consent to anything that Neithan wants, so his permission is not necessary. Nethan agrees for them both.",

He sews tapestries that track the prices of certain commodities in the market, netting huge profits for himself and his very exclusive hedge fund (i.e. he completely ignores the true power of his gift). Gon, however, is not so lucky. He has never managed anything before, and thus, runs his business into the ground. Due to a steadily increasing depression, he turns to prostitution and alcohol to make him feel better. Neithan begins giving Gon a monthly stipend to cover his expenses.",
