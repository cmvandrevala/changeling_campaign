Changeling Campaign
===================

This repository contains all of the supporting documentation that I am going to use in my changeling campaign. It consists of two main parts: a list of character details and a timeline of events.

The character details will contain stats for the main characters in Anansesem City as well as descriptions of each character and their major associated events. The timeline is an interactive chart that allows you to see the movements of characters around the world.
