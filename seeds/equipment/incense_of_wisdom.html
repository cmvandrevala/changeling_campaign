<h1>Incense of Wisdom</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

Actually, it should be called Incense of Bad Ideas.  It was made by a hobgoblin who was trying to create a smoke bomb that would cause enemies to turn on each other. Instead, he created a gently smoking twig that gives its holder bad ideas.  He came up with the name for the incense while holding the twig.

<h2>Appearance</h2>

It looks like a small piece of cinnamon.
