<h1>Bone Seed</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

Actually, it should be called Incense of Bad Ideas.  It was made by a hobgoblin who was trying to create a smoke bomb that would cause enemies to turn on each other. Instead, he created a gently smoking twig that gives its holder bad ideas.  He came up with the name for the incense while holding the twig.

<h2>Appearance</h2>

It is a small sliver of bone.  The source of the bone is unknown (perhaps some sort of mammal).

<h2>Effects</h2>

When a bone seed is planted in the ground and watered, a ghastly looking tree grows up after about 24 hours. The final tree will be about 15-30 feet tall depending on the original size of the seed (larger seeds yield larger trees).  The tree will literally be made of bones.

The tree does not grow gradually.  Instead, it will remain motionless and then suddenly snap and pop, growing another branch.  The tips of the branches are very sharp and can cut someone if they are not careful.  However, it is only lethal damage with no extra effects.
