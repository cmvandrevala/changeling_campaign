<h1>Hedge Beast Grenade</h1>

A grenade that when thrown, unleashes an angry hedge beast. It is actually rather similar to a pokeball except that the creature inside wants to kill everyone including the caster.

<h2>Description</h2>

Usually the hedge beast has been starved for a few days since it was trapped inside the grenade. Additionally, the space inside the grenade is cramped and rather unpleasant.  It immediately attacks whoever is closest to it.

The more the characters pay for the grenade, the more dangerous the creature inside will be.  However, the creature makes no distinction between friend or foe.  It will attack whoever is closest, one by one, until the battle is over (including the party).  It can be calmed down / scared away / defeated / etc like any normal hedge beast.

<h2>Appearance</h2>

The grenade itself actually looks like a military-grade fragmentation grenade (i.e. green bumpy surface with a silver mechanism and pin).  Thus, carrying it around in polite society might cause some problems.

<h2>Effects</h2>

<p>When the pin is pulled and the grenade is thrown, an angry and starved hedge beast will emerge from the grenade.  A dramatic failure means that the creature will either emerge already deceased or right in front of the player who threw it.  A successful throw means that the creature will appear in front of the intended target.</p>
